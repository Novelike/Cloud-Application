# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Code Quality Tools

This project uses ESLint and Prettier to ensure code quality and consistent formatting.

### ESLint

ESLint is configured to enforce code quality rules and catch potential issues.

Available commands:
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint on all JavaScript and JSX files in the src directory
- `npm run lint:fix`: Run ESLint and automatically fix issues when possible

### Prettier

Prettier is configured to ensure consistent code formatting across the project.

Available commands:
- `npm run format`: Format all JavaScript, JSX, JSON, CSS, SCSS, and Markdown files in the src directory
- `npm run format:check`: Check if files are properly formatted without making changes

### Combined Command

- `npm run lint-format`: Run both ESLint fix and Prettier format in sequence

### Pre-commit Hook

This project uses Husky and lint-staged to automatically run ESLint and Prettier on staged files before committing. This ensures that all committed code meets the project's coding standards.
